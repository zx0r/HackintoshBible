## Scientific Methodology of Troubleshooting 
#### (By example) Addressing "System Fails to Enter Auto Sleep Mode" on macOS Hackintosh

<small>

### 1. Problem Definition
#### Objective: Clearly define the issue where the display sleeps, but the system does not enter sleep mode.

### Steps:
1. **Describe the Symptom**:
   - The display turns off after the configured time, but the system remains active (fans running, power LED on).
2. **Define Expected Behavior**:
   - The system should enter sleep mode after the display sleeps, powering down most components and consuming minimal power.
3. **Establish Scope**:
   - The issue occurs consistently when the system is idle for the configured sleep timer (e.g., 10 minutes).

---

### 2. Data Collection and Observation
#### Objective: Gather empirical evidence to understand the problem's context and characteristics.

### Steps:
1. **Record Observations**:
   - The display turns off after 10 minutes, but the system remains active.
   - System logs show no errors related to sleep.
   - `pmset -g` output indicates `sleep` is set to 10 minutes, but the system does not sleep.
2. **Reproduce the Issue**:
   - Leave the system idle for 10 minutes; observe that the display sleeps but the system does not.
3. **Collect Baseline Data**:
   - Under normal conditions, the system should enter sleep mode after the display sleeps.

---

### 3. Hypothesis Generation
#### Objective: Formulate plausible explanations for the observed issue.

### Steps:
1. **Identify Potential Causes**:
   - Incorrect `pmset` configuration.
   - Misconfigured ACPI/DSDT tables.
   - Incompatible or missing kexts (e.g., `HibernationFixup.kext`, `RTCMemoryFixup.kext`).
   - Background processes preventing sleep.
2. **Prioritize Hypotheses**:
   - Incorrect `pmset` configuration is the most likely cause, as it is easily testable.

---

### 4. Hypothesis Testing
#### Objective: Validate or invalidate each hypothesis through systematic experimentation.

### Steps:
1. **Design Experiments**:
   - Test the system with different `pmset` configurations.
   - Example: Set `sleep` to 5 minutes and observe behavior.
2. **Execute Tests**:
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     sudo pmset -a sleep 5
     ```
   - Observe if the system enters sleep mode after 5 minutes.
3. **Analyze Results**:
   - If the system still does not sleep, the issue is not related to the `sleep` timer.

### 5. Solution Implementation
#### Objective: Apply the validated solution to resolve the issue.

### Steps:
1. **Select the Optimal Solution**:
   - If the issue persists, investigate ACPI/DSDT tables or kexts.
2. **Apply the Solution**:
   - Patch ACPI/DSDT tables to ensure proper sleep behavior.
   - Add necessary kexts (e.g., `HibernationFixup.kext`, `RTCMemoryFixup.kext`) to the `EFI/OC/Kexts` folder and `config.plist`.
3. **Verify Resolution**:
   - Confirm that the system enters sleep mode after the display sleeps.

---

### 6. Preventive Measures and Documentation
#### Objective: Mitigate future occurrences and document the resolution process.

### Steps:
1. **Identify Root Cause**:
   - The root cause was misconfigured ACPI/DSDT tables and missing kexts.
2. **Implement Preventive Actions**:
   - Ensure all Hackintosh systems use properly patched ACPI/DSDT tables and necessary kexts.
3. **Document the Process**:
   - Create a troubleshooting guide for sleep-related issues on Hackintosh systems.

---

### 7. Continuous Improvement
#### Objective: Enhance problem-solving capabilities through reflection and knowledge sharing.

### Steps:
1. **Evaluate the Process**:
   - The hypothesis testing phase was efficient, but data collection could be streamlined.
2. **Update Knowledge Base**:
   - Add the ACPI/DSDT patches and kext configurations to the Hackintosh setup guide.
3. **Share Findings**:
   - Present the findings at a team meeting and publish a case study.

### Example Application of the Methodology
#### Problem: System Fails to Enter Auto Sleep Mode (Display sleeps, but system does not)

### 1. Problem Definition
- Symptom: Display turns off after 10 minutes, but the system remains active.
- Expected Behavior: System should enter sleep mode after the display sleeps.
- Scope: Issue occurs consistently when the system is idle for 10 minutes.

### 2. Data Collection and Observation
- Observations: Display sleeps, but system remains active; no errors in logs.
- Reproduction: Issue occurs every time the system is idle for 10 minutes.
- Baseline Data: System should enter sleep mode after display sleeps.

### 3. Hypothesis Generation
- Potential Causes: Incorrect `pmset` configuration, misconfigured ACPI/DSDT tables, missing kexts.
- Prioritized Hypothesis: Incorrect `pmset` configuration is the most likely cause.

### 4. Hypothesis Testing
- Experiment: Set `sleep` to 5 minutes and observe behavior.
- Results: System still does not sleep after 5 minutes.
- Analysis: Issue is not related to the `sleep` timer.

### 5. Solution Implementation
- Solution: Patch ACPI/DSDT tables and add necessary kexts.
- Verification: System now enters sleep mode after the display sleeps.

### 6. Preventive Measures and Documentation
- Root Cause: Misconfigured ACPI/DSDT tables and missing kexts.
- Preventive Actions: Ensure all Hackintosh systems use properly patched ACPI/DSDT tables and necessary kexts.
- Documentation: Created troubleshooting guide for sleep-related issues on Hackintosh systems.

### 7. Continuous Improvement
- Evaluation: Hypothesis testing was efficient, but data collection could be streamlined.
- Knowledge Update: Added ACPI/DSDT patches and kext configurations to the Hackintosh setup guide.
- Knowledge Sharing: Presented findings at a team meeting and published a case study.
